Hi, I'm @renabridged. With a bachelor's degree in Physics from the Universidade Federal de Lavras, UFLA, MG, I am currently pursuing my master's degree in the field of Statistical Physics. In my thesis, I aim to delve into the multifractality of the population and infrastructure in Brazilian cities, aiming to elucidate the factors influencing productivity and economies of scale.

Through my studies, I seek to uncover the hidden patterns and complexities that shape urban environments, exploring how the multifractal nature of cities impacts their functionality and economic dynamics. By analyzing various aspects such as population distribution, infrastructure networks, and economic indicators, I aim to provide insights into the intricate relationships between these elements.

Utilizing statistical physics methodologies, I intend to develop models and algorithms that can capture the multifractal behavior observed in urban systems, providing a deeper understanding of how these systems evolve and adapt. By uncovering the underlying mechanisms driving productivity and economies of scale, my research endeavors to contribute to the development of more efficient and sustainable urban planning strategies.

With a passion for both physics and the study of cities, I am excited to embark on this research journey, exploring the intersection of these fields and striving to contribute to the scientific understanding of urban dynamics. I look forward to the insights and discoveries that will emerge from my exploration of the multifractal nature of Brazilian cities and their impact on economic performance.

I am interested in unraveling the intricate world of complex systems, where patterns emerge from the interplay of countless elements. Exploring the captivating realm of scale laws in urban and biological systems captivates my curiosity, as I strive to comprehend the underlying principles that govern their behavior. Delving into the captivating field of urban science, I seek to understand the dynamics that shape cities and their ecosystems, unearthing the hidden connections that bring them to life.

Intrigued by the mesmerizing beauty of fractal geometry, I find myself drawn to its self-replicating patterns that manifest across various scales. The captivating science of networks beckons me, as I explore the intricate webs that connect entities and unravel their complex interactions. Engaging in agent-based modeling, I relish the opportunity to simulate and observe the emergent phenomena that arise from the behaviors of individual agents, shedding light on complex systems' dynamics.

Data science, with its vast potential for knowledge extraction, captures my attention as I dive into the world of information and uncover meaningful insights hidden within vast datasets. Additionally, I find great fascination in the realm of topological data analysis, where I can explore the structural properties and relationships that underlie complex datasets, unlocking new perspectives and understanding.

In a nutshell, my interests lie in the captivating realms of complex systems, scaling laws, urban and biological science, fractal geometry, network science, agent-based modeling, data science, and topological data analysis. I am eager to delve deeper into these fields, uncovering the intricate mysteries they hold and contributing to the advancements of scientific knowledge.
